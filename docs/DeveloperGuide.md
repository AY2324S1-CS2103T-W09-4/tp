## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `PersonInformationPanel`, `SummaryStatisticScreen` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.
The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the event book data i.e., all `Event` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueEventList`)
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores the currently 'selected' `Event` objects as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Event>`
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save address book data, event book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from `AddressBookStorage`, `EventBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### LinkedIn/Github feature

#### Implementation

The LinkedIn/Github feature consists of two parts - adding the linkedin/github username to the candidate's data, and viewing the profile. 

The addition is performed by the `AddLCommand` and `AddGCommand` classes. They extend `Command` and override the `execute()` method to add the username to the candidate's existing details. 

It involves the command `AddLCommand` and `AddGCommand` classes, and their corresponding parsers `AddLCommandParser` and `AddGCommandParser`, that take in user input and return either `AddLCommand` or `AddGCommand` objects.

When executed, `AddLCommand` and `AddGCommand` find the person at the specified index in the list, and adds either their linkedin or github username to the `LinkedIn` or `Github` class associated with that `Person`. The list is then updated, and a `CommandResult` object is returned.

The viewing is performed by the `LinkedInCommand` and `GithubCommand` classes. They extend `Command` and override the `execute()` method to redirect the user to the candidate's LinkedIn or Github profile on the browser.

It involves the command `LinkedInCommand` and `GithubCommand` classes, and their corresponding parsers `LinkedInCommandParser` and `GithubCommandParser`, that take in user input and return either `LinkedInCommand` or `GithubCommand` objects.

When executed, `LinkedInCommand` and `GithubCommand` append the username of the person to the base URLs for LinkedIn and Github, and open the URL in the browser.



Given below is an example usage scenario and how the linkedin and github feature behaves at each step.

**Step 1.** The user launches the application. `JABPro` will be initialized with the current saved state

User should see the UI as shown below.

![Ui](images/Ui.png)

**Step 2.** The user wants to add the LinkedIn username to the first person in the list. The user enters the command `addL 1 u/alexyeoh` to add the username to the candidate's existing details.

The following sequence diagram shows how the AddL and AddG operations work:

<puml src="diagrams/AddLSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="AddLSequenceDiagram" />
<puml src="diagram/AddGSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="AddGSequenceDiagram" />

User should see the UI as shown below after entering `addL 1 u/alexyeoh`

![AddL](images/addLState.png)

**Step 3.** The user can then view the linkedin profile for the candidate at index 1. The user enters the command `linkedin 1`.

User should see the UI asa shown below after entering `linkedin 1`

![LinkedIn](images/linkedinState.png)


#### Alternatives considered ####

Alternative 1 (Chosen): 

`LinkedIn` and `Github` are attributes of a `Person` that can be added using the `AddLCommand` and `AddGCommand` and are initially provided with default string values when a Person is initialised.

Pros: There may be candidates who do not provide their LinkedIn or Github profiles as part of their application.

Cons: Person is always initialised with empty values for LinkedIn and Github, and those values would have to be manually set using the commands.

Alternative 2:

`LinkedIn` and `Github`, like all other attributes of `Person`, are required to be non null.

Pros: These details will be provided at the time of addition of a new Person, without having to add them later separately.

Cons: It limits the scope for candidates that do not possess a LinkedIn or Github account.

Alternative 3:

`LinkedIn` and `Github` are attributes of `Person` but are allowed to be null.

Pros: This accounts for candidates that do not have those social profiles, and allows for their addition at the time of Person creation

Cons: With defensive programming in mind, not the best approach having to deal with null values.

=======
### View feature

#### Implementation

The view feature is implemented using the `ViewCommand` class. It extends `Command` and overrides the `execute()` method to display the person's details in full in a new window.

Like every other command class, it involves a command `ViewCommand` class and a parser `ViewCommandParser`. `ViewCommand Parser` takes in the user input and returns a `ViewCommand` object.    
  
When executed, `ViewCommand` saves the index of the person to be viewed as `LastViewedPersonIndex` in the `Model` and returns a `CommandResult` object with `isView` property being true.  

By having a `isView` property in `CommandResult`, the `MainWindow` component is able to toggle the `UI` to the view the person of the `LastViewedPersonIndex` after the command has been executed.


Given below is an example usage scenario and how the view feature behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application. The `AddressBook` will be initialized with the current saved address book state

User should see the UI as shown below.  

![Ui](images/Ui.png)

Step 2. The user wants to see the full information displayed for the first person in the displayed list. The user enters the command `view 1` to view the first person in the list.

The following sequence diagram shows how the view operation works:

<puml src="diagrams/ViewSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="ViewSequenceDiagram" />

**Note:** The lifeline for `ViewCommand` and `ViewCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

User should see the UI as shown below after entering `View 1`  

![View](images/viewState.png)

Step 3. The user can then read or process the information stored for the viewed person.



**Note:** The view command can be most effectively used with `search` and `list`. Since the view index is dependent on the Index on the filtered list shown, the user can view the profile after filtering for specific properties in a person using `search` and sorting them using `list`.

Alternatives considered

Alternative 1 (Chosen):   
The view feature is implemented using the `ViewCommand` class. It extends `Command` and overrides the `execute()` method to display the person's details in full in a new window.  

Pros: Follows the Software Design Patterns of Command. This is the same pattern used for all other commands thus creating consistency.  

Cons: Tougher to implement since other commands do not have the ability to trigger the `ViewCommand` in their execution.  That is we specifically need to set the isView property to true if we want the `ViewCommand` to occur simultaneously with another command.  

Alternative 2 (Not Chosen):  
The view feature is implemented using the `ViewCommand` class. It extends `Command` and overrides the `execute()` method to display the person's details in full in a new window.  
Commands that involved viewing will extend `ViewCommand` instead of the `Command` class. All of them are returned as `ViewCommand` to ensure toggling of the UI after command is executed.    

Pros: Arguably a more OOP approach since all commands that trigger view IS-A `ViewCommand`.  

Cons: You cannot implement any command that does not involve viewing but inherits from any command that is a children of `ViewCommand`.  
An example could be trying to create identical commands that does not toggle the UI after execution. This would require duplication of the exact same command code but inheriting from `Command` instead of `ViewCommand`.


### Search feature

#### Implementation

The search feature is implemented using the `SearchCommand` class. It extends `Command` and overrides the `execute()` method to
filter users by the specified parameters.

The search parameters from the user input are parsed using the parse method in the `SearchCommandParser` class. `SearchCommandParser::Parse`
takes in the search parameters from the user input and combines them into a list of predicates. This list of predicates is then 
passed as an argument to the `SearchCommand` constructor and the method returns a `SearchCommand` instance with the associated list of predicates.

Currently, the search parameters could belong to any of the three following categories: `Name`, `Status`, and `Tag`. Prefixes
`n/`, `st/` and `t/` are used to denote the category of the search parameters respectively. E.g. `search n/alex st/interviewed t/swe`

The list of predicates is a list comprising predicate objects whose classes implement the `Predicate` class in Java.
Each category has its own predicate class i.e. `NameContainsKeywordPredicate`, `StatusContainsKeywordPredicate`, `TagContainsKeywordPredicate`
and each class overrides the `test` method which returns true if the persons list contains any of the given names/status/tags.

Finally, the execute method in `SearchCommand` class invokes the `updateFilteredPersonList(predicatesList)` which will 
update the list of persons displayed.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the search mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application.

Step 2. The user executes `search n/john st/offered t/swe` command to filter candidates having the name john,
offered status and tagged as swe. 

The following sequence diagram shows how the search operation works:

**Note:** The lifeline for `SearchCommand` and `SearchCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

<puml src="diagrams/SearchSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="SearchSequenceDiagram" />

Step 3. The user should see the UI below upon entering `search n/john st/interviewed t/friends`.

![View](images/search.png)

**Note:** The current implementation of search allows users to search by any of the categories individually or by different combinations of the categories.
It also allows users to specify more than one search parameter for each category e.g. `search n/alex bernice`

## Events feature

#### Implementation

The Events feature extends the original ideas of the `AddressBook` to store two types of entities - Candidates and Events associated with candidates.

It consists of two parts - adding the events to JABPro, and viewing the events.

THe addition is performed by the `EventCommand` class. It extends `Command` and overrides the `execute()` method to add the event to JABPro.

It involves the `EventCommand` class and its corresponding parser, `EventCommandParser`, that takes in the user input and returns an `EventCommand` object.

When executed, `EventCommand` finds the person the event is associated with, and adds the name of the person, and other details such as description and start and end time, as input by the user. The existing `EventBook` is then updated to reflect this addition, and a `CommandResult` object is returned.

The viewing is performed by the `ScheduleCommand`. It extends `Command` and overrides the `execute()` method to open the `Events Window` and display the events.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** There is another way of viewing events, that is through the `Events` tab. Refer to the [UserGuide](UserGuide.md#viewing-events-schedule) for more information.


</box>

Given below is an example usage scenario highlighting how the `Events` feature behaves at each step.

**Step 1.** The user launches the application. The `EventBook` will be initialized with the current saved event book state.

User should see the UI as shown below.

![Ui](images/Ui.png)

**Step 2.** The user wishes to add an "Interview" event for the first candidate in the list. The user enters the following command:

`event 1 d/Interview bt/2023-11-12 10:00 et/2023-11-12 12:00`

This command adds a new event to the `EventBook` that is associated with the first person in the list, with the description as "Interview" and the start and end time as specified.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The start and end times are required to follow a specific format. Refer to the [UserGuide](UserGuide.md#adding-an-event-event) for more information.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how the `Event` operation works:

<puml src="diagrams/EventSequenceDiagram.puml" altText="EventSequenceDiagram"></puml>

User should see the UI as shown below after executing the aforementioned command [It is assumed that the first candidate in the list is Alex Yeoh].

![Event](images/event.png)

![EventWindow](images/eventwindow.png)

#### Alternatives considered ####

***Duplicate Events***

Alternative 1 (chosen):

`Events` associated with the same `Person`, having the same description are allowed. It is upto the user to input more detailed descriptions to differentiate between them, and to promote readability.

Pros: It makes the `EventBook` a complete product of the user's choice as no restrictions are imposed, and the user can enter data as per their preferences and their convenience.

Cons: It might lead to confusion if multiple events of the same person, having the same description are added. Hence, it is recommended that the user enters detailed descriptions to distinguish events from one another.

Alternative 2:

`Events` associated with the same `Person`, having the same description are considered duplicate `Events` and hence, are rejected by the system.

Pros: It prevents redundant data from being stored and accidental addition of multiple events of the same type for the same person

Cons: It restricts users from entering data that might be understandable or convenient for them. [For example: If the user creates two Events with the description "Interview" for the same person, they might have a distinct idea of what each of those Events mean, but the system prevents them for making this addition].

### Planned Enhancements

There are certain feature flaws that we have identified and would like to improve on in the future.

1. **Improve what identifies as a unique person**
   Currently, a person is uniquely identified by their name. This is not ideal as there may be multiple persons with the same name. We would like to improve this by using a unique identifier such as internal ID or NRIC number.
   This would allow us to have a more robust system that can handle multiple persons with the same name.

2. **Improve the edit feature** 
   Currently, it falls short of the user's expectations as it does not allow the user to add on to existing tags. We would like to improve this by creating a feature that allows the user to add on to existing tags.  
   Thereby users can add on to existing tags without having to retype all the previous tags.
3. **Improve the summary statistic implementation** 
    Currently, if the applicants do not have a good spread of scores, the summary statistics will not be very useful. We would like to improve on this by implementing a more robust summary statistics that can handle small sample sizes and outliers.
    Additionally, you can only use the summary statistic table for comparison after you have inputted most of the scores. At that point, it might be more relevant to use the filter feature instead. Thereby we hope to add more visualisations like graphs to the summary statistics table to make it more useful for comparison.
4. **Improve the filter feature**
    Currently, the filter feature might be too flexible for the user. That is it works on the displayed list and not across the board. We would like to improve on this by implementing a filter feature that works across the database.  
    This makes it more intuitive and logical for the user to use since the user would expect the filter feature to work across the database and not just the displayed list.


### Non-Functional Requirements

1.  Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `11` or above installed.
2.  Should be able to `hold up to 1000 persons` without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
3.  A user with above `average typing speed for regular English text` (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
4.  System should respond within a `reasonable amount of time` (e.g. < 2 second) for typical usage (e.g. listing 1000 persons).
5.  Should not deal with `external database` or `network connections`.
6.  Product is expected to be used by a `single user` only.
7.  Product is `not expected to contain API` for other software to communicate with.
8.  Product is expected to be used in a system with at least 4GB RAM and `1GB free disk space`.
9.  Product Visuals should be `unambiguous` and clear to the user
10. Commands should be `easy to remember` and `intuitive` to use
11. Product should be `consistent` in its visuals and commands formatting
