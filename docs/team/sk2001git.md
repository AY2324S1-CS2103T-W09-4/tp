Adding a remark to a person: `remark`

Edits a remark to an existing person to the address book

Format: `remark INDEX r/REMARK`

* Edits the remark for the person at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed person list. The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
* The previous remark is not saved, and instead is replaced by the inputted remark. The command does not add to the existing remark
* You can empty out a remark by inputting an empty string

Examples:
*  `remark 1 r/Great attitude, hardworking` Edits the remark of the 1st person on the list to have a remark `Great attitude, hardworking`
*  `remark 1 r/` Empties the remark of the 1st person.


**Remark** | `remark r/REMARK` <br> e.g., `remark 1 r/Great attitude, hardworking`
