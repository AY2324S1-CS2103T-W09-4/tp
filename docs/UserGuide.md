# JABPro User Guide

## Product Overview

JobApplicationsBook Pro (JABPro) is a **desktop app for hiring managers of companies to ease the management of applicants, optimized for use via a  Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, JABPro can get your applicant management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest `jabpro.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W09-4/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your JabPro.

4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar jabpro.jar` command to run the application.<br>  
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>

   Some example commands you can try:

    * `remark 1 r/Great attitude, hardworking`: edits the remark of the 1st person on the list to have a remark `Great attitude, hardworking`

    * `search n/John`: Searches for applicants whose names contain the keyword `John`

    * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* When using parentheses ( ) with items separated by the pipe symbol |, at least one item must be included. <br>
  e.g in the command `search (n/KEYWORD [MORE KEYWORDS] | st/KEYWORD [MORE KEYWORDS] | t/KEYWORD [MORE KEYWORDS])`, it is necessary to specify at least one search category.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous AddressBook home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
